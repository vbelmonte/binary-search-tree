# Binary Search Tree
## Description
This repository contains code that implements a Binary Search Tree and its respective methods. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the nature of a Binary Search Tree and how its methods can be used to search through an array of information when taking time complexity and space complexity into account. The methods of this program include:

1. buildTree
2. insert
3. delete
4. find
5. levelOrder
6. preOrder
7. inOrder
8. postOrder
9. height
10. isBalanced
11. rebalance
12. mergeSort
